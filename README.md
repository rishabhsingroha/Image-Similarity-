#Image Similarity App

**Problem Statement:**
In the era of digital content, users often struggle to find similar images among vast collections. This can be particularly challenging for photographers, designers, and content creators who need to organize and retrieve visually similar images efficiently.

**Working:**
The Image Similarity App leverages cosine similarity to measure the similarity between uploaded images. The app allows users to:
1. Upload a reference image and a collection of images for comparison.
2. The app processes the images using feature extraction techniques, transforming them into vector representations.
3. Cosine similarity is calculated to determine how closely the uploaded images resemble the reference image.
4. The app then displays a ranked list of similar images, showcasing the most similar results at the top.

**Results:**
The app provides users with an intuitive interface, enabling quick and accurate retrieval of similar images. Users can visualize the results and gain insights into their image collections, enhancing their workflow in creative projects. By effectively identifying similar images, the app aids in organization, inspiration, and content curation.
